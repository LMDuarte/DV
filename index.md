### Journalism in the age of Data

 Every day, companies like Facebook or Google collect, analyze, and export that data. Companies like them provided us with more data than a single person could comprehend. It may look chaotic and may deal with a significant volume of variables and represents thousands of human beings, but it can be manageable. Data visualization can create a manageable way of seeing that data. The video "Journalism in the age of Data" explores the way data visualization can aid our understanding of data. 
 
 
Data visualization can bring a comprehensive look into the chaotic data-driven world we are experiencing. We are more aware than ever that our actions can be translated to data points. With the internet, we are aware of how much information a single human being can create.  However, not everyone knows how to access, analyze, and understand the available data. Even when the data is handled correctly, it also needs to be translated into a digestible and attractive visual. The video "Journalism in the age of Data" explores how news organizations tackle conveying complex information into a digestible manner while telling a narrative with it.  The video also discusses how data visualization should be interactive, aesthetically, pleasing, and informative. 


As humans, we are interested in understanding ourselves and our surroundings. We want to understand topics such as crime statistics and voting patterns. However, we also want to understand our habits. For example, in the video at (27:42), Nicholas Felton showcases data visuals representing his year. His data recording can be seen as a detailed diary of his life, doting down details that seem insignificant by themselves but resulted in a meaningful picture once they were all put together. Projects like Felton's disproof the idea that numbers and statistics are of disinterest to the common public. For example, something similar was presented at the beginning of the year by Spotify. The music player provided a presentation to their users, laying their listening habits of 2019. The app used the data collected from the users to not only showcase the user's favorite artist, but also guessed the users "mood" thought the year, and how that mood changed with the seasons.


Data points by themselves can be insignificant, and once they are all together, they can be messy, but they can show solutions to our problems or precautions to upcoming ones if presented clearly. The video "Journalism in the age of Data" presented how data visualization can help us understand the abundance of data at our disposal. The video explained how data should be presented in aesthetically pleasing, eye-catching, and intuitive, interactive, and straightforward visuals. It also explored how "all that" is a tall order that requires a deep understanding of the data and design. It takes teams of people to put together infographics that will deliver the right message. It is a complicated task, but we must understand how to manage all the available data.

### Teaching to See

As the video "Teaching to See" demonstrates, Inge Druckery follows a design philosophy that has taught her students to see the world's beauty. Inge has a way of deconstructing the world around her in their simplest shapes. By doing this, she can construct visuals that tell precise stories. 

The importance of abstract images can never be understated. Some art pieces may carry deep meaning, while others demonstrate technique and beauty. The beauty in designing abstract art pieces is the ability to control the viewers' eyes. The artist creates a well-crafted flow, in which they can guide the viewer to observe the image as it is intended. Although there is beauty in abstract images, creating abstract art allows the artist to observe the world around them deeply. This observation can be accomplished with minimal shapes, as is demonstrated in Inge Druckery's assignment of the five lines. She asked for her student to merely put down five lines in a given format. The placements of the lines drastically change the negative space of the image.

The practice of drawing enhances the artist's attention to detail. Inge's explained that you must observe the lighting, shadow, and texture to capture an object. It is an exercise that forces observation out of an individual. For example, when drawing live animals, you only have moments to capture the moving subject's essence. Drawing live animals, more than attention to detail, it enhances understanding. 

Additionally, drawing as an exercise does improve the craft. The assignment of Inge lines represents to me a personal understanding of abstract art. It shows removing meaning from objects and just drawing for the sake of it. Removing meaning from the final product reduces anxiety in the process. If the end piece does not need to mean or represent anything, the process becomes enjoyable and carries greater flow. 

As seen in "Teaching to See," the 1979 Beethoven poster shows a functional design that is creative, meaningful, and visually appealing. Like the information of time and date can be presented in such lively and attractive ways, such can data. By applying the philosophy of Igne Druckery to data visualization, we could reach many intrigued eyes. It is never enough to be correct or to have the right data. If the message cannot be appealing to listen to or see, then the data is useless. It is not enough to appeal to academics or those who actively seek information science presents. As researchers, we must appeal to a broad audience. We must apply more artistic and visually interesting designs in our data presentation.

### Small Details

When designing a visual, you have to make specific decisions for the lines, shapes, and the colors you will use. As data analysts, we cannot ignore the importance of visualization. The truth is that people need an incentive to care about data. Picking the correct lines, shapes, and colors can create an appealing and informative visual. A great example of the use of shapes, lines, and color is music visualization videos.

Music visualization videos are visuals in which a melody plays in the background while different shapes attempt to represent what is being played. Sound as a visual is taking what is being picked up by one sense and presenting it to another. The visuals are abstract, popping, and colorful.

In most music visualization mediums, the colors reflect the mood of the melody. Warmer colors represent more vibrant songs, while cooler colors can be reserved for somber melodies. Recently this kind of visualization can also be seen in "RGB lighting." There are products such as lightbulbs or LED light strips, that attempt to visualize music in your living room. This can be a popular addition to home theaters or gaming systems. Another layer to color that should be noted; it's how vibrant it is. The color's intensity can change in the same visual, depending on the beat or volume of an instrument. Some of these changes in color and vibrancy lead to the appearance that the light is dancing.
Shapes can play an essential part in designing a piece of music visually. The shapes presented in a visual can be presentative of either notes or peaks in the audio. An existing method of visualizing music is a music sheet. Some music visualization videos loosely follow the idea of a music sheet. Like a music sheet, shapes move left to the right and move up and down depending on the pitch. Shapes replace the notes, and all the instruments are presented in one visual. The choice of shape has less to do with the melody being represented and more, with visual clarity and aesthetics. If multiple instruments are characterized, then all the instruments should have distinct shapes.

A stylish way to represent sound is with sound waves. Sound in itself is a wave and can be represented visually as such. A sound wave visual can be presented by a series of graphs or by lines peaking with the audio. Although other visualizations imitate dancing, this sort of visuals mimics speaking. The way lines move up and down at high speed makes it look like moving lips. The use of sound waves is prevalent because of its simplicity. It only needs one line to be able to represent sound.
