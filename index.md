### Journalism in the age of Data

 Every day, companies like Facebook or Google collect, analyze, and export that data. Companies like them provided us with more data than a single person could comprehend. It may look chaotic and may deal with a significant volume of variables and represents thousands of human beings, but it can be manageable. Data visualization can create a manageable way of seeing that data. The video "Journalism in the age of Data" explores the way data visualization can aid our understanding of data. 
 
 
Data visualization can bring a comprehensive look into the chaotic data-driven world we are experiencing. We are more aware than ever that our actions can be translated to data points. With the internet, we are aware of how much information a single human being can create.  However, not everyone knows how to access, analyze, and understand the available data. Even when the data is handled correctly, it also needs to be translated into a digestible and attractive visual. The video "Journalism in the age of Data" explores how news organizations tackle conveying complex information into a digestible manner while telling a narrative with it.  The video also discusses how data visualization should be interactive, aesthetically, pleasing, and informative. 


As humans, we are interested in understanding ourselves and our surroundings. We want to understand topics such as crime statistics and voting patterns. However, we also want to understand our habits. For example, in the video at (27:42), Nicholas Felton showcases data visuals representing his year. His data recording can be seen as a detailed diary of his life, doting down details that seem insignificant by themselves but resulted in a meaningful picture once they were all put together. Projects like Felton's disproof the idea that numbers and statistics are of disinterest to the common public. For example, something similar was presented at the beginning of the year by Spotify. The music player provided a presentation to their users, laying their listening habits of 2019. The app used the data collected from the users to not only showcase the user's favorite artist, but also guessed the users "mood" thought the year, and how that mood changed with the seasons.


Data points by themselves can be insignificant, and once they are all together, they can be messy, but they can show solutions to our problems or precautions to upcoming ones if presented clearly. The video "Journalism in the age of Data" presented how data visualization can help us understand the abundance of data at our disposal. The video explained how data should be presented in aesthetically pleasing, eye-catching, and intuitive, interactive, and straightforward visuals. It also explored how "all that" is a tall order that requires a deep understanding of the data and design. It takes teams of people to put together infographics that will deliver the right message. It is a complicated task, but we must understand how to manage all the available data.
